# Integration_intuition
Program with the aim of giving the user intuition behind traditional integration calculations.  

The functionality of the program is the numerically approximated calculations of the area in a bounded region under the graph given by an equation. The area is calculated by partitioning into rectangles with the width dx, value chosen by a user, and summing the areas of the rectangles. 
The equations are divided into 2 groups: polynomial (e.g. x^2) and mathematical functions (e.g. logarithms with different bases, exponentials, sin, etc.). 
Moreover, the program traditionally calculates a precise value of the area, with the idea of dx -> 0 (number of rectangles -> infinity). 
As the result, we can see the difference between precise and approximated, also dependent on the value of dx, calculations.
