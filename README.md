# Integration_intuition
Program with the aim of giving the user intuition behind traditional integration calculations.

## Functionality of the program
1) Traditional precise calculations of defined integrals.
2) Rectangular method of numerical integration, taking only the rectangles under a slope.
3) The program then prints a difference between these 2 calculations, which is dependent on the value of dx, chosen by the user. The result is printed to `Integral_calculator.txt` file.

## Project is created with:
* mingw32 compiler

## Run on Terminal
```
gcc main.c -o test
test
```
